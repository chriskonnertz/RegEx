# RegExMaker
Use methods to fluently create a regular expression in PHP

Inspired by [PHPVerbalExpressions](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/PHPVerbalExpressions)

## Installation

Through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require chriskonnertz/regexmaker
```

From then on you may run `composer update` to get the latest version of this library.

It is possible to use this library without using Composer but then it is necessary to register an 
[autoloader function](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md#example-implementation).

> This library requires PHP 5.6 or higher.
